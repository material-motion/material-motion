## Statistics

We are building an open source analytics dashboard to track the health of our projects over time. All of our historical statistics are publicly available here:

Check out the code driving the statistics:

[The server](https://github.com/material-foundation/compute-oss-dashboard) and [the daemon](https://github.com/material-foundation/graphite-oss-daemon).
