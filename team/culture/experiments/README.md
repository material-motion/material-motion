# Experiments

Experimentation is an important part of our team's culture. We use experiments to inform decisions, to explore new ideas, and to have a safe place to fail.

Each platform and language has an `experiments` GitHub repo. We use these repos to house code that isn't ready for production use. This means that APIs are subject to change at **any point in time** without warning.

## Starting an experiment

    git clone git@github.com:material-motion/material-motion-experiments-<yourproject>.git
    cd material-motion-experiments-<yourproject>
    
    mkdir -p material-motion-experiments-/<some name>

You can now begin working within your new experimental folder.

We recommend creating a README.md in your experimental folder outlining the scope of the experiment.
