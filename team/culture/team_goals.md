# Team goals

We use the [Starmap](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/) to guide our ongoing development.

As a team we **operate in the open**.

Our general philosophy:

- Elevate existing solutions. Avoid re-inventing wheels.
- In the absence of existing solutions, build great ones.
- Add more ideas to the Starmap as drafts, flesh them out, and then encourage their development across applicable platforms.

Specific end goals:

- Able to express interaction and motion consistently across platforms.
- Elevate awareness of motion frameworks, tools, and education.
- Provide languages of motion capable of expressing rich interactions.
