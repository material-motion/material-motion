# August 11-17, 2016

## Hackweek summary

The core team met in San Francisco last week for an in-person hackathon. Here's the summary of things we explored:

- Composability of plans/performers. [Read the spec](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/runtime/Performer-composition).
- Tossable demo built for Android and iOS.
- Draggable demo built for Web.
- Expanding cards interaction for iOS.
- Implementation of an animation using Material Motion in a Swift Playground.

Composability is the highlight of the week. This feature is what will allow us to create platform-agnostic motion families.

## 🌟 Starmap 🗺

📝 Drafting the [Motion family](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/motion-family.html) and [Serialization](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/specifications/serialization) spec.

📝 Drafting the [Gesturable](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/motion_family/gesturable) motion family.

📝 Defining our tech stack and ownership areas. The goal is to ensure that we have discrete areas of ownership for new team members.

**Bridge motion families** are libraries that allow material motion users to incorporate existing platform animation and interaction libraries.

**Material motion families** are our platform-agnostic libraries.

## Android platform

🎉 **Prototyping** Tossable demo.

🎉 Runtime now supports composable plans.

📝 **Motion family** Physics.

📝 **Motion family** Gestural.

📝 Physics engine library.

📝 Gestural library - PanGestureDetector.

## Apple platforms

🎉 Runtime now supports composable plans.

🎉 [Gestures](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-family-gestures-swift) motion family now available.

🎉 [POP](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-family-pop-swift) motion family now available.

## Web frameworks

📝 **Prototyping** Circles interaction.

## Tooling

📝 Improving our [team onboarding](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/team/essentials/frequent_contributors/onboarding) documentation and tools as we've been taking on new 20%'ers.
