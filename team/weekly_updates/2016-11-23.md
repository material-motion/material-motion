## Starmap

Updates to [`AppliesVelocity`](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/plans/AppliesVelocity)
and [`PausesSpring`](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/plans/PausesSpring) due to iterations on photo transition example.

## Android platform

## Apple platforms

🎉 **Runtime** Published v6.0.1. [View the release notes](https://github.com/material-motion/runtime-objc/releases/tag/v6.0.1).

🎉 **Runtime** is now synced internally.

📝 **Runtime** internals have been significantly reworked and simplified. Unit test tools will soon be available for dependent libraries.

📝 **CoreAnimation** Working on block-based animation API. This feature will greatly improve the ability for existing code bases to move to Material Motion. [View the diff](http://codereview.cc/D1904).

Example UIKit code:

```
self.squareView!.alpha = 0
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1) {
  self.squareView!.alpha = 1
}
```

Equivalent Material Motion code (simply a replacement of `UIView.animate` with `runtime.tween`):

```swift
squareView.alpha = 0
runtime.tween(withDuration: 1) {
  squareView.alpha = 1
}
```

📝 **CoreAnimation** Working on block-based animation API. This feature will greatly improve the ability for existing code bases to move to Material Motion. [View the diff](http://codereview.cc/D1904).

📝 **CoreAnimation** Built a demo of a scroll-view-driven animation using the Timeline:

🎉 **CoreAnimation transitions** Published v1. [View the release notes](https://github.com/material-motion/coreanimation-transitions-swift/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

Includes the [`TransitionTween`](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/plans/TransitionTween) motion language term.

🎉 **POP transitions** Published v1. [View the release notes](https://github.com/material-motion/pop-transitions-swift/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

Includes the [`TransitionSpring`](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/plans/TransitionSpring) motion language term.

🎉 **POP** Published v2 and v2.1. [View the v2 release notes](https://github.com/material-motion/pop-swift/releases/tag/v2.0.0). [View the v2.1 release notes](https://github.com/material-motion/pop-swift/releases/tag/v2.1.0).

Includes the [`PausesSpring`](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/plans/PausesSpring) and [`AppliesVelocity`](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/plans/AppliesVelocity) motion language terms.

Example describing a "tossable element" interaction:

```swift
runtime.addPlans([
  // Allow the element to be dragged.
  Draggable(withGestureRecognizer: pan),

  // Always be anchored to the provided position.
  SpringTo(position, destination: anchoredPosition),

  // Pauses the spring simulation while the gesture recognizer is active.
  PausesSpring(position, whileActive: pan),

  // Feeds the pan gesture recognizer's velocity into the spring on gesture completion.
  AppliesVelocity(position, onCompletionOf: pan)
], to: layer)
```

📝 **Transitions** Nearled landed the Photo Transition demo. [View the diff](http://codereview.cc/D1905).

Latest demo showing a fully functional "flick-to-dismiss" interaction on the photo. Note that velocity from the gesture feeds into the spring simulation:

## Web frameworks

📝 **WebAnimations** Iterating on Tween implementation. [View the diff](http://codereview.cc/D1991).

📝 **Prototype** Working prototype of `SpringTo`, `Draggable`, and `Tween` proved out with the Runtime v1. [View the codepen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QGdGRp?editors=1111).
