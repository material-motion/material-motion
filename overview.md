# Overview

## Why a starmap?

The Material Motion team spans platforms, languages, personalities, and skill sets. We're driven by a common desire to improve the state of the art in interactive application design.

The Starmap is our forum for proposing and hashing out ideas. It allows us to converge on shared considerations and to discuss long-term goals.

## Our goals

**Nurture software design patterns for motion and interaction**

**Blur the line between engineering and design**

**Provide a catalog of motion**

## Sustainable culture

**Operate in the open from day one**

**Encourage community ownership**

**Lower the barrier to casual contribution**
