# Interactive Motion Starmap 🌟🗺

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we explore [essential primitives](primitives.md), [software design patterns](plan-execution-pattern.md), [motion runtimes](concepts/runtimes.md), and more.

This book is a starmap 🌟🗺. It defines high-level goals and identifies patterns. It is not the API documentation for any particular solution. Our [Community index](community_index/) links to implementations for specific platforms and languages.

## Evolution

This book is in a very early drafting phase. It will evolve over time.

Please read the chapter on [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to this book. Feel free to [start discussions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/material-motion/material-motion-starmap/discussions) or to leave comments in-line.

## Who should read this?

The chapter titled "Engineering concepts" is for software engineers familiar with animation systems.

The chapter titled "Material motion language" is for motion designers and tool creators.
