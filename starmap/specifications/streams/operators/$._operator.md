# $._operator specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `_operator`.

## Overview

`_operator` is a means by which new operators can be created. An operator can change, add, or remove values in the stream. An operator can even change the type of the stream.

## MVP

### Expose _operator API

```swift
class MotionObservable<V> {

  public func _operator<U>(_ work: (MotionObserver<U>, T) -> Void) -> MotionObservable<U> {
    return MotionObservable<U>({ observer in
      return self.subscribe(next: { value in
        work(observer, value)
      }, active: observer.active).unsubscribe
    }
  }
}
```
